{{< alert context="danger" >}}
Lotus Docs is currently in the very early stages of development and is, therefore, not ready for use in production. You're welcome to test the theme yourself, and contributions to the project a very welcome.
{{< /alert >}}

Welcome to the Lotus Docs user guide. This guide shows you how to start creating technical documentation sites using Lotus Docs, including site customisation and using Lotus Docs' features and templates.

## What is Lotus Docs?

Lotus Docs is a theme for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator specifically designed for technical documentation sets and includes many best practices by default. Use Lotus Docs to get a working and reliable documentation site up and running fast, leaving valuable time to focus on creating content for your users.

The site youâ€™re currently reading was built using the Lotus Docs theme! Many of the features and configurations available in the Lotus Docs theme are on display here. You can clone this entire site and edit it to suit your projects, or explore the site, its source and see what Lotus Docs can do.

{{< alert context="warning" >}}
**Source hosting and management:** Our theme and [site source files](https://github.com/colinwilson/lotusdocs) live on GitHub, which is the recommended approach for most projects. You can also keep your project files in GitLab, BitBucket, locally, or wherever you like. Be aware that where your source files live may affect the Lotus Docs features you can use (such as letting users file documentation issues) and site deployment options.

**Site deployment:** You can find out about deployment options in Previews and Deployment. This site uses [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Is Lotus Docs for me?

Lotus Docs is (currently) suited to small or medium technical documentation sets with 100 or fewer pages of docs. That's not to say Lotus Docs won't scale to larger documentation sets, just that its navigation and site structure may not be sufficient for larger data sets without heavy customisation.

The good news is that development to accommodate such sites is ongoing. So keep an eye on the [Lotus Docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/colinwilson/lotusdocs) for updates.
