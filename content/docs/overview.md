{{< alert context="danger" >}}
Lotus Docs is currently in the very early stages of development and is therefore not ready for use in production. You're welcome to test the theme yourself and contributions to the project a very welcome.
{{< /alert >}}

Welcome to the Lotus Docs user guide. This guide shows you how to get started creating technical documentation sites using Lotus Docs, including site customisation and how to use Lotus Docs' features and templates.

## What is Lotus Docs?

Lotus Docs is a theme for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator that’s specifically designed for technical documentation sets and includes many best practices by default. Use Lotus Docs to get a working and reliable documentation site up and running fast, leaving valuable time to focus creating content for your users.

The site you’re currently reading was built using the Lotus Docs theme! Many of the features and configurations availble in the Lotus Docs theme are on display here. You can clone this entire site and edit it to suit your own projects, or just explore the site, its source and see what Lotus Docs can do.

{{< alert context="warning" >}}
**Source hosting and management:** Our theme and [site source files](https://github.com/colinwilson/lotusdocs) live on GitHub, which is the simplest approach for most projects. However, you can also keep your project files in GitLab, BitBucket, locally, or wherever you like. Keep in mind that where your source files live may affect the Lotus Docs features you can use (such as letting users file documentation issues) and site deployment options.

**Site deployment:** You can find out about deployment options in Previews and Deployment. This site uses [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Is Lotus Docs for me?

Lotus Docs is (currently) suited to small or medium technical documentation sets with 100 or less pages of docs. That's not to say Lotus Docs won't scale to larger documentation sets, just that its navigation and site structure may not be sufficient for larger data sets without heavy customisation.

The good news is that development to accommodate larger sites is ongoing. So keep and eye on the [Lotus Docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/colinwilson/lotusdocs) for updates.
